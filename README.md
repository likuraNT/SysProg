#Realisation of "cat" on C.

This program using stdin to save and stdout to show text msg, which user can input with. 
Also, if you add file after ex.: ./"NameOfProgram" ../ex.sh you will see the file insides (like cat ex.sh).

In program we have two functions: main and filecopy.
Main includes args, which will influence a programm future.
FileCopy is using to copy file, if you use own file and then you will see inside of it.

chmod +x program
./program
